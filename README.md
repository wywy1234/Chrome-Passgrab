# Chrome-Passgrab
*ALL OF THIS WAS INSPIRED BY [Jakoby](https://github.com/I-Am-Jakoby). I deserve no credit for this. This was just my fix for what he started. I got the code to work but could never get the ducky script to run smoothly. So I took his WiFi grabber ducky script as inspiration and smashed it into this. Thank you jakoby for your skillz!

*I bought a flipper and started playing around with some ducky script. Found the hack5 Chrome browser exfil script that, with a little editing, works. I have place my exited version of that script here as well the bad thing is I was never able to get the script to send it correctly. So I figured id rip a little from here and a little from there and make this. Hope you enjoy!
#### Directions
*Simply fill your Discord webhook in the $dc='' or your Dropbox url in $dc='' and save it to your ducky device. You should receive a file with your payload in those locations!
